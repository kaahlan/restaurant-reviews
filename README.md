## Project-Specifications

For this project, I had to incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application while still maintaining the included functionality. I took a static design that lacked accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I added a service worker to cache files and begin to create a seamless offline experience for users.

## How-To-Launch

Website can be accessed online [here](https://kaahlan.github.io/restaurant-reviews/).

You can also click on "Clone or download" and download ZIP, then extract the files.

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
